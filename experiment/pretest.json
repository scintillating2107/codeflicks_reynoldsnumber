      "question": "What does the Reynolds number primarily determine in a fluid flow system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Fluid temperature",
        "b": "Flow resistance",
        "c": "Type of flow (laminar, transitional, turbulent)",
        "d": "Density of the fluid"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Temperature affects fluid properties but not directly the flow type.",
        "b": "Resistance is a consequence, not a primary classification criterion.",
        "c": "Reynolds number helps predict whether flow is laminar, transitional, or turbulent. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number'>Learn more</a>",
        "d": "Density is a component in calculating Reynolds number, not what it determines."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Viscosity appears in the denominator of the Reynolds number formula.",
        "b": "Density is in the numerator and affects the value.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Transitional flow generally occurs between Re 2000 to 4000.",

        "a": "D stands for diameter and is critical in determining the flow cross-section. <a href='https://www.britannica.com/science/Reynolds-number'>Source</a>",
        "b": "Density is ρ, not D.",
        "c": "Distance traveled is not used in this formula.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Capillaries usually exhibit laminar flow.",
        "b": "Slow oil flow in narrow pipes is typically laminar.",
        "c": "Smoke movement is chaotic but driven by convection, not classic fluid flow.",
        "d": "Large rivers with high velocity usually have turbulent flow. <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/turbulent-flow'>More info</a>"
