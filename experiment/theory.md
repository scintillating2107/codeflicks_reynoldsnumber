### Theory:

The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity used in fluid mechanics to predict the type of flow in a pipe or channel. It is defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and is given by the formula:

Re= (ρ x u x D)/𝜇



Where:

𝜌 = density of the fluid (kg/m³)

𝑢 = mean velocity of fluid flow (m/s)

𝐷 = diameter of the pipe (m)

𝜇 = dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa·s)

𝜈 = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m²/s)

The Reynolds number helps determine the flow regime:

Laminar Flow (Re < 2000): Fluid particles move in parallel layers with no disruption. The flow is smooth and orderly.

Transitional Flow (2000 < Re < 4000): The flow is unstable and fluctuates between laminar and turbulent.

Turbulent Flow (Re > 4000): Fluid motion is chaotic and mixed, with eddies and vortices.
