      "question": "Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity because:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Its units cancel out during calculation",
        "b": "It has no physical meaning",
        "c": "It is only used for gases",
        "d": "It represents time"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "All units cancel in the formula, making it dimensionless. <a href='https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/reynolds-number-d_237.html'>Source</a>",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Laminar flow is smooth and silent.",
        "b": "Turbulent flow is chaotic and can cause noise and vibration. <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/turbulent-flow'>Source</a>",
        "c": "Transition is less likely but may introduce minor disturbances.",
        "d": "Static flow means no motion, hence no vibration."

        "c": "Increasing pipe diameter",
        "d": "Increasing fluid viscosity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Higher velocity increases Re, leading to more turbulence.",
        "b": "Density has a limited effect compared to viscosity.",
        "c": "Increasing diameter may increase Re due to larger D.",
