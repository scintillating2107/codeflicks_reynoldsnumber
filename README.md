### About the Experiment 

In this experiment, the Reynolds number is determined to study the nature of fluid flow in a pipe. By varying the flow rate and observing the flow characteristics, we classify the flow as laminar, transitional, or turbulent based on the Reynolds number value. The experiment helps understand how fluid behavior changes with velocity and viscosity, and reinforces the concept of Reynolds number as a key dimensionless parameter in fluid mechanics to predict flow regimes.
